1. **Symmetric Substitution Rules**:
    - When designing substitution rules, ensure that each step of the substitution maintains or creates symmetry in the sequence. For instance, the rule might involve splitting the sequence into two halves and applying similar but directionally opposite rules to each half.

2. **Selection of Special Seeds**:
    - Select an initial seed that is self-reflective (e.g., a palindrome). Such a seed will serve as a basis for symmetric substitution rules, which might preserve the symmetry on both sides as the substitution progresses.

3. **Mirror Growth Mechanism**:
    - Design substitution rules such that for each symbol’s substitution, characters are added not only to one end of the sequence but also corresponding mirror characters to the other end. This would require context-sensitive rules where the substitution depends not only on the current symbol but also its position and surrounding symbols.

4. **Bidirectional Substitution Consideration**:
    - Instead of the usual unidirectional substitution, consider bidirectional substitution, where part of the rules handle the left half of the sequence and another set of rules handle the right half.

5. **Dynamic Adjustment of Rules**:
    - To maintain symmetry, substitution rules might need to adjust dynamically as the sequence grows. For example, rules might change to preserve symmetry once the sequence reaches a certain length or meets certain criteria.

6. **Self-Similarity and Fractal Structures**:
    - Symmetric fixed points might be related to self-similar structures and fractals. Studying how fractals generate complex symmetric structures through simple repeated rules could provide insights for the design of fixed points.

7. **Computer Simulations and Experiments**:
    - Use computer programs to simulate different substitution rules to observe which ones can generate sequences with reflective properties. Experiments may uncover rules that are not easily derived directly from theory.

An example to support the conjecture could be as follows:

**Example**: 
Let's consider a binary string with a simple substitution rule where each digit `0` is replaced by `01` and each `1` is replaced by `10`, applied in both directions:

- For a single `0`, the substitution would be `01` to the right and `10` to the left, resulting in `1001`.
- For a single `1`, the substitution would be `10` to the right and `01` to the left, resulting in `0110`.

Starting with a palindromic seed such as `0` (or `1`), we can see that the application of these rules preserves the symmetry:

- Start with `0` (which is palindromic).
- Apply the substitution to get `1001` (which is also palindromic).
- Applying the rule to each outer digit of `1001`, we get `0110100`, and so on.

**Formal Conjecture**:
Given a substitution rule set \( R \) with symmetrical properties and a palindromic seed \( S \), there exists an infinite sequence \( A \) such that for every finite prefix \( P \) of \( A \), the application of \( R \) to \( P \) results in a string that is a prefix of \( A \) and maintains the reflective symmetry. This sequence \( A \) is the fixed point with reflectivity.

This conjecture could be formalized further and tested through computer simulations, mathematical proof, or counterexamples. It sets the stage for exploring the generation of sequences with intriguing reflective properties through the application of carefully designed substitution rules.
